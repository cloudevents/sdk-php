# PHP SDK for [CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec)

## Status

This SDK currently supports the following versions of CloudEvents:

- [v1.0](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md)

## Installation

Install the SDK using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```sh
$ composer require cloudevents/sdk-php
```

## Create a CloudEvent

```php
use CloudEvents\V1\CloudEvent;
use CloudEvents\V1\CloudEventImmutable;

// Immutable CloudEvent
$immutableEvent = new CloudEventImmutable(
    '1n6bFxDMHZFChlI4TVI9tdzphB9',
    '/examples/php-sdk',
    'com.example.type',
    ['example' => 'first-event'],
    'application/json'
);

// Mutable CloudEvent
$mutableEvent = new CloudEvent(
    '1n6bFxDMHZFChlI4TVI9tdzphB9',
    '/examples/php-sdk',
    'com.example.type',
    ['example' => 'first-event'],
    'application/json'
);

// Create immutable from mutable or via versa
$event = CloudEventImmutable::createFromInterface($mutableEvent);
$event = CloudEvent::createFromInterface($immutableEvent);
```

## Serialize/Deserialize a CloudEvent

```php
use CloudEvents\Serializers\JsonDeserializer;
use CloudEvents\Serializers\JsonSerializer;

// JSON serialization
$payload = JsonSerializer::create()->serializeStructured($event);
$payload = JsonSerializer::create()->serializeBatch($events);

// JSON deserialization
$event = JsonDeserializer::create()->deserializeStructured($payload);
$events = JsonDeserializer::create()->deserializeBatch($payload);
```

## Marshal/Unmarshal a CloudEvent

```php
use CloudEvents\Http\Marshaller;
use CloudEvents\Http\Unmarshaller;

// Marshal HTTP request
$request = Marshaller::createJsonMarshaller()->marshalStructuredRequest($event);
$request = Marshaller::createJsonMarshaller()->marshalBinaryRequest($event);
$request = Marshaller::createJsonMarshaller()->marshalBatchRequest($events);

// Marshal HTTP response
$request = Marshaller::createJsonMarshaller()->marshalStructuredResponse($event);
$request = Marshaller::createJsonMarshaller()->marshalBinaryResponse($event);
$request = Marshaller::createJsonMarshaller()->marshalBatchResponse($events);

// Unmarshal HTTP message
$events = Unmarshaller::createJsonUnmarshaller()->unmarshal($message);
```

## Testing

  lint          Show all current linting errors according to PSR12
  lint-fix      Show and fix all current linting errors according to PSR12
  sa            Run the static analyzer
  tests         Run all tests locally

  tests-docker  Run tests within supported PHP version containers
```

## Community

- There are bi-weekly calls immediately following the [Serverless/CloudEvents
  call](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec#meeting-time) at
  9am PT (US Pacific). Which means they will typically start at 10am PT, but
  if the other call ends early then the SDK call will start early as well.
  See the [CloudEvents meeting minutes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OVF68rpuPK5shIHILK9JOqlZBbfe91RNzQ7u_P7YCDE/edit#)
  to determine which week will have the call.

directory. In particular, in there you will find information concerning
how SDK projects are
[managed](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/docs/SDK-GOVERNANCE.md),
